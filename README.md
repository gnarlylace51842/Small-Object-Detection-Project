Using TF2 Hub and Object detection software, created a program to recognize objects based on their shapes and color in any image.

To use the project, download the file and pip install each import. 
Then link a dataset as a reference for objects you want to detect in MODEL_URL. 
Then, in COCO_LABELS, list each object you want found in a dictionary

After, run, with the image you want, and objects will be detected!
